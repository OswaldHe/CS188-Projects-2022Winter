> Our project mainly works on investigate and reproduce text-guided image generation model and procedure art creation model (or potentially other image transformer that has artistic values), and connect the two models together to build neuron network that can create artworks with only words. Some artists have already applied AI/Deep Learning in their art creation (VQGAN-CLIP), while the development of diffusion model and transformers may provide more stable and human-like output.

## Introduction
Our project idea is inspired by [PaintTransformer](https://github.com/wzmsltw/PaintTransformer) which turns a static image into a oil painting drawing process and [VQGAN + CLIP Art generation](https://github.com/nerdyrodent/VQGAN-CLIP) which turns texts into artwork. We want to combine the idea from both project and design a model which could give artistic painting process from text described. The group members are Wenjie Mo and Zifan He.
